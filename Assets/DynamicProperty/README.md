# Dynamic Properties for Unity

A flexible system for defining and editing game data properties (int, float, bool, enum, DateTime, TimeSpan, etc.) with metadata-driven drawers in the Unity Inspector.  
Supports **32-bit and 64-bit storage**, custom attributes for type/range/step, and game-specific enums bound via Project Settings.

---

## üì¶ Installation

1. Open your Unity project.
2. In `Packages/manifest.json`, add:

```json
"com.yourname.dynamic-properties": "https://github.com/yourname/dynamic-properties.git"
```

3. Unity will fetch the package automatically.

üöÄ Usage & Setup

1. Define your enum for property IDs in your game assembly:

```csharp
public enum PropertyId
{
    [PropertyType(PropertyValueType.Int), DisplayName("Health"), MinMax(0, 9999)]
    Health,

    [PropertyType(PropertyValueType.Float), DisplayName("Speed"), MinMax(0, 50), Step(0.1f)]
    Speed,

    [PropertyType(PropertyValueType.Enum), PropertyEnum(typeof(WeaponType))]
    WeaponType,
}
```

2. Bind your enum in Editor

Go to Edit ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Dynamic Properties.

Select your PropertyId enum in the dropdown.

The system now reflects your metadata everywhere.

3. Use in ScriptableObjects
Add fields with DynamicProperty32 or DynamicProperty64:

```csharp
[CreateAssetMenu(menuName = "Data/Character")]
public class CharacterData : ScriptableObject
{
    public List<DynamicProperty32> stats32;
    public List<DynamicProperty64> stats64;
}
```

In the Inspector you‚Äôll see dropdowns for keys and value fields adapting automatically.

üìù Core Notes

Storage

DynamicProperty32 = int-backed (ints, floats, bools, short enums).

DynamicProperty64 = long-backed (longs, doubles, 64-bit enums, ticks-based DateTimes/TimeSpans).

Metadata
Use attributes (PropertyType, DisplayName, MinMax, Step, PropertyEnum) on your enum fields to drive Inspector behavior.

Editor Persistence
Binding is stored in ProjectSettings/DynamicProperties.asset (no stray assets in your project).
Binding survives domain reloads & recompiles automatically.

Extensible
You can add new property value types and drawers with minimal boilerplate.

‚úÖ Example

In the Inspector, with the example PropertyId above:

Health shows as an int slider (0‚Äì9999).

Speed shows as a float field with step 0.1.

WeaponType shows as a dropdown of enum values.
